Combat outcomes influence not only character progression but also story branching and NPC relationships.

### Balanced Risk-Reward Mechanics

The corruption system creates a constant tension between power and consequence. Players can access devastating shadow abilities and enhanced combat effectiveness, but each use of corrupted power carries risks that extend beyond the immediate encounter. This creates a dynamic where optimal play requires careful consideration of long-term consequences alongside tactical effectiveness.

## System Architecture Overview

### Turn-Based Combat Engine

The combat system operates on a turn-based framework that provides players with sufficient time to consider their options while maintaining engagement through dynamic enemy AI and environmental interactions. Each combat round consists of initiative determination, action selection, resolution, and status effect processing.

**Initiative System**: Character initiative is calculated using a combination of base attributes, equipment bonuses, and situational modifiers. The formula incorporates Might for physical readiness, Intellect for tactical awareness, and corruption level for supernatural reflexes, creating a system where different character builds can excel in different scenarios.

**Action Point Economy**: Each character receives a base allocation of action points per turn, modified by attributes, equipment, and status effects. Actions consume varying amounts of points, from basic attacks requiring minimal investment to complex abilities demanding significant resources. This creates meaningful resource management decisions within each turn.

**Turn Resolution**: Actions are resolved in initiative order, with simultaneous actions handled through a priority system that considers action type, character attributes, and environmental factors. This ensures fair resolution while maintaining tactical complexity.
