## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure:**
- **EquipmentManager** - Main container component managing state and API calls
- **CharacterEquipment** - Equipment slot visualization and management
- **InventoryGrid** - Item browsing and selection interface
- **EquipmentTooltip** - Detailed item information display

**State Management:**
- **React Hooks** for local component state
- **Session Storage** for persistent data
- **API Integration** with proper error boundaries
